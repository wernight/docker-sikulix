**[SikuliX](http://www.sikulix.com/)** (previously known as *Sikuli*) automates anything you see on the screen. It uses image recognition powered by [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) to identify and control GUI components. This is handy in cases when there is no easy access to a GUI's internals or the source code of the application or web page you want to act on.

You want to automate some repetitive tasks in:

  - daily usage of applications or web pages
  - playing games
  - administration of IT systems and networks
  - test applications or web pages
  - make/run a demo or training material live


## Usage

Contains latest official **SikuliX** inside a container based on **KasmVNC**.

Simplest usage is:


```bash
$ docker run --name sikulix --rm -p 3000:3000 -v $PWD/config:/config wernight/sikulix
```

... or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  sikulix:
    image: docker.io/wernight/sikulix
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
```

Once started, open http://localhost:3000 to access the UI.

See [SikuliX official documentation](https://sikulix.github.io/docs) for the scripting language.

It's based on [LinuxServer.io docker-baseimage-kasmvnc](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-kasmvnc);
see their documentation for supported features like:

  - Change port.
  - Add authentication.
  - Support GPU.
  - [PRoot Apps](https://github.com/linuxserver/proot-apps) (e.g. `proot-apps install chromium`)

The simplest is to then have your application also run from within that X11 virtual session.

Comes preinstalled with:

  - **SikuliX** v2.0.6 SNAPSHOT
  - **Tessereact** used by SikuliX for OCR (you may want to set `Settings.OcrLanguage = "eng"` in your script).
  - **Firefox** web browser pre-installed.
  - **scrcpy** (and ADB) to remote control an Android device (see section).
  - **SimpleScreenRecorder** to record the screen (either for a demo or to see what it did afterwards).
  - **key-mon** to display key strokes.


## Tips

  - After resizing the browser window (especially when elarging it), restart SikuliX so that it takes the entire screen area.
  - Middle click the title bar to switch to the app under the current window (especially useful when maximized).
  - Right click an empty space on the desktop to start the browser or other applications.
  - Change the screenshot shortcut (default is Ctrl-Shift-2) in SikuliX preferences to something like Ctrl-Shift-S to avoid clashing with KasmVNC shortcuts.
  - After downloading a new version of this image, consider clearing `config/.config/openbox/` so as to fetch the latest changes which a else stored on `/defaults/`.


### Control an Android device

In general:

 1. On the Android device: Enable USB Debugging (in Developer Options, tap "Build number" 7 times in Settings â†’ About Phone).
 1. Start this container and either:
      - [Lower latency] Start with additional Docker argument `--device /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb` (if it fails try `--privileged --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --security-opt label=disable`).
      - [Less permissions] Install ADB on your host machine and run `adb tcpip 5555`.
 1. Inside the container start the "scrcpy (console)" shortcut or execute:
    ```bash
    # If it fails try running first "adb connect <DEVICE_IP>:5555" or add "--tcp=<DEVICE_IP>:5555" argument to scrcpy.
    scrcpy --stay-awake --turn-screen-off
    ```

If you want to run an Android emulator, check out:

  - https://github.com/google/android-emulator-container-scripts
  - https://github.com/budtmo/docker-android

... the simplest if you have KVM on your system, is:

 1. Generate a key by running inside the SikuliX container:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.android
    adb keygen ~/.android/adbkey
    cat ~/.android/adbkey
    ```
 1. Create/update your `docker-compose.yml` to be like:
    ```yaml
    services:
      sikulix:
        image: docker.io/wernight/sikulix
        ports:
          - 3000:3000
        volumes:
          - ./config:/config
        links:
          - android
      # https://github.com/google/android-emulator-container-scripts
      android:
        image: us-docker.pkg.dev/android-emulator-268719/images/30-google-x64:30.1.2
        environment:
          ADBKEY: |
            -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
            ... YOUR KEY HERE
            -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
        devices:
          - /dev/kvm
    ```
 1. Start it all up and from the container running SikuliX simply execute in a terminal:
    ```bash
    $ adb connect android:5555
    $ scrcpy
    ```

### Run advanced/headless

**HEADLESS PROBABLY WON'T WORK AS OF CURRENT STATE - YOU'LL HAVE TO FIDDLE WITH IT**

First you need to run a X11 program, for example you may run *Chromium* using *Xvfb* (but you may as well run *Android* the same way):

    $ docker run --rm --name chromium -v /tmp/.X11-unix -it markadams/chromium-xvfb xvfb-chromium

Now run an existing script on it:

    $ docker run --rm -e DISPLAY=:99 --volumes-from chromium -v $PWD:/code:ro wernight/sikulix -- sikulix -c -r /code/my_script.sikuli

See [SikuliX command-line options](https://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.org/en/latest/faq/010-command-line.html) or run `sikulix -h`.

WARNING: Due to [bug #183](https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/issues/183) use only the short command-line form for flags (e.g. `-h` instead of `--help`).

Keep in mind that to forward X you'll need:

  * Run as the same user.
  * Use the same `DISPLAY` environment variable (usually `:99` if using Xvfb).
  * Possibly forward and mount `XAUTHORITY` or `/tmp/.X11-unix` (as read-only).

Note: Here we run as `root` to make it simpler, but you should avoid it (for security). Add `--user` flag and run as any user you want, like any random integer in [2000-32000] as long as that user has read access to your mounted files, and it's the same as the one running X11 (i.e. Xvfb).
